# Retreon

Retreon is a web application to watch over RetroAchievements.org's api in real time and display its updates in a fancy way.

This is a fork from original project created by @spaceglace. The original development was stopped 2 years ago, so i decided to work on it a little more as an opportunity to learn about it's framework (VueJs) and Golang.
